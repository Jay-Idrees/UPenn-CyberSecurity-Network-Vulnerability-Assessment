# Network Security Vulnerability Assessment

## Random Usefule Things (RUTs)


**Conversion tools**
All these conversions can be tricky. Fortunately, there is a web tool that can easily convert binary to IP and IP to binary.

I created this repository to capture things I learned on the topic of network security during my certification training at the University of Pensylvania

## Network Security

- **Request and Response Method**
Two-way convrsation b/w client and the server

- **LAN Benefits** Security, speend and performance, easy to add devices

- **WAN** Many LANs connected together, benifit- Able to share resources over a much larger geographic area. Disadvantages- needs encryption for data exchange from LAN to WAN and difficult trouble shooting if outside the LAN- Traffic issues


## Topologies

- **Ring** Can be Uni/Bidirectional, every device is the point of failure, can have slow speed/latency. But there is no central node data manager

- **Linear** Every device is a point of failure, same latency issues

- **Star** Has a centeral node, if that goes down the network goes down but if the a divice fails- that does not affect the network- Easy to extend the network- Distance b/w the central node and the device matter

- **Bus** Fast but wastes brandwith to all the devices equally, two devices cannot transmit data simultaneously

- **Tree** All devices below the the top computer get disconnected from the network 

- **Fully connected** All devices are connected with eachother- very complicated to setup, very difficult to add a device as will require so many connections

- **Mesh** Only a subset of the computers are fully connected 

- **Hybrid** Combination of above- Most modern networks are hybrid

## Data Signals in Binary Bit vs Byte
- 1 bit = 1 or 0. Basically every digit in a binary code is a bit
- 1 byte= `10110111` or 8 bits=1 byte. You can also call 1 byte=1 octet of bits This is 10^8 or 10 million possibilities. This then also means that 4 combinations of different types of 'byte' 10 million bytes = an ip address. For example  `00001010.00000000.00000011.11111110` is an ip address which when interpreted in hexadecimal conversion = `10.0.3.254`. Devices have MAC addreses using which they are able to connect to a network using an ip. The ips are allocated per ISP service provider.  The mac address is used to associate a device to a network. This also means that an ip address itself is a piece of dataa that is used a marker for data packets to distinguish between host and destination. There will always be a host and a destination ip involved during data communication/digital communcation/data exchange. 
      - `00000000` = 0
      - `00000001` = 1
      - `00000010` = 2
      - `00000011` = 3
      - `00000100` = 4
      - `00000101` = 5

- Binary to hexadecimal
- For example, `11000111 00000110 10100110 11100110 11110110 01000110` represents `C7 6 A6 E6 F6 46`.

- **ASCII  Converts Binary to Hexadecimal and is responsible for visulization of the text on the screen from binary sequence vibrations**

- For example, `01101000 01101001`  represents `hi`. So this means that all letters of the ABC and 123 are converted SPECIFIC pieces of sequences. The human readable version of the binary signal is called **decimal**
- So these so called **hexa-decimals**

## IP Addresses IP Stands for Internet Protocol

There are about 5.9 billion IP addresses of which about 4.3 billion use IPv4, about 3.7 billion IP addresses are public

- Public or Private. The list below are **Private** If its not included in the range below then it is public

- An IP address is always 4 octets or 32 bits, 1 octet = 8 bits

- `192.234.3.0/24` Means that the first 3 octets or first 24 bits are fixed, the last 8 bits after the first 24 or the last octet is variable

- The range of 1 octet or section is between 0 and 255

- `192.243.3.0/24` means the range of IPs is` 192.243.3.0` - `192.243.3.255`

- IP address `192.243.3.0/0` means all the ips in the world ~4.3 million ipv4

- IP address `192.243.3.0/32` means that there is only one IP and that ip is 192.243.3.0 because it means that first 32 bits must be fixed which is the entire length of the IP address


- **Private IPs** 

```
    |Starting IP  | Ending IP       | IP Addresses Available |  
    |-------------|-----------------|------------------------|
    | 10.0.0.0    | 10.255.255.255  | 16,777,216             |  
    | 172.16.0.0  | 172.31.255.255  | 1,048,576              |
    | 192.168.0.0 | 192.168.255.255 | 65,536                 |
```
**IPV4-Internet Protocol Version 
 An IP address by IPv4 Standards 

 So by creating a protocol we have used mahematical rules of 1s and 0s on/off to create unique sequences for numbers (0 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 9) such that there is a unique combination of 1s and 0s for each number. 

 Organizations are provided a range of IPs to asign between departments- typical departments are Finance and Marketing


## Layers of the Network - The OSI Model- Open System Interconnections

- Network Layer 1 Physical
- Network Layer 2 Data Link
- Network Layer 3 Network
- Network Layer 4 Transport
- Network Layer 5 Session
- Network Layer 6 Presentation
- Network Layer 7 Application

- **Enumeration** Pocess of gathering data regarding a network - This info typically incudes ips, ports, MAC addresses, device information

## Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) - Organization that manages the IP addresses

## Protocols by layer- Standardized rules to define how data is transmitted
- Address Resolution Protocol - ARP- Layer 2 



## Ports

## Commands
- `ping` to check if the hosts are accepting connections. 
- `fping` Checking multiple pings at the same time. `sudo apt install fping` for installing this command
