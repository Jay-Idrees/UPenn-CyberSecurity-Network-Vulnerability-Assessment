# Network Security Vulnerability Assessment


Date of initial publication. 2/7/2021
I created this repository to capture things I learned on the topic of network security during my certification training at the University of Pensylvania

## Network Security

- **Request and Response Method**
Two-way convrsation b/w client and the server

- **LAN Benefits** Security, speend and performance, easy to add devices

- **WAN** Many LANs connected together, benifit- Able to share resources over a much larger geographic area. Disadvantages- needs encryption for data exchange from LAN to WAN and difficult trouble shooting if outside the LAN- Traffic issues


## Topologies

- **Ring** Can be Uni/Bidirectional, every device is the point of failure, can have slow speed/latency. But there is no central node data manager

- **Linear** Every device is a point of failure, same latency issues

- **Star** Has a centeral node, if that goes down the network goes down but if the a divice fails- that does not affect the network- Easy to extend the network- Distance b/w the central node and the device matter

- **Bus** Fast but wastes brandwith to all the devices equally, two devices cannot transmit data simultaneously

- **Tree** All devices below the the top computer get disconnected from the network 

- **Fully connected** All devices are connected with eachother- very complicated to setup, very difficult to add a device as will require so many connections

- **Mesh** Only a subset of the computers are fully connected 

- **Hybrid** Combination of above- Most modern networks are hybrid


## Layers of the Network - The OSI Model- Open System Interconnections

- Network Layer 1 Physical
- Network Layer 2 Data Link
- Network Layer 3 Network
- Network Layer 4 Transport
- Network Layer 5 Session
- Network Layer 6 Presentation
- Network Layer 7 Application

- **Enumeration** Pocess of gathering data regarding a network - This info typically incudes ips, ports, MAC addresses, device information

## Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) - Organization that manages the IP addresses

## Protocols by layer- Standardized rules to define how data is transmitted
- Address Resolution Protocol - ARP- Layer 2 

## IP Addresses
## Ports

## Commands
- `ping` to check if the hosts are accepting connections. 
- `fping` Checking multiple pings at the same time
